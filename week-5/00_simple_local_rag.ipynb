        "* **Augmented** - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).\n",

        "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outptus of LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two primary improvements can be seen as:\n",
        "1. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are incredible but they are prone to potential hallucination, as in, generating something that *looks* correct but isn't. RAG pipelines can help LLMs generate more factual outputs by providing them with factual (retrieved) inputs. And even if the generated answer from a RAG pipeline doesn't seem correct, because of retrieval, you also have access to the sources where it came from.\n",
        "2. **Work with custom data** - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale text data. This means they have a great ability to model language, however, they often lack specific knowledge. RAG systems can provide LLMs with domain-specific data such as medical information or company documentation and thus customized their outputs to suit specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors of the original RAG paper mentioned above outlined these two points in their discussion.\n",

        "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
        "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
        "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it\n",
        "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",

        "For example you could use RAG for:\n",
        "* **Customer support Q&A chat** - By treating your existing customer support documentation as a resource, when a customer asks a question, you could have a system retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a \"chatbot for your documentation\". Klarna, a large financial company, [uses a system like this](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/) to save $40M per year on customer support costs.\n",
        "* **Email chain analysis** - Let's say you're an insurance company with long threads of emails between customers and insurance agents. Instead of searching through each individual email, you could retrieve relevant passages and have an LLM create strucutred outputs of insurance claims.\n",
        "* **Company internal documentation chat** - If you've worked at a large company, you know how hard it can be to get an answer sometimes. Why not let a RAG system index your company information and have an LLM answer questions you may have? The benefit of RAG is that you will have references to resources to learn more if the LLM answer doesn't suffice.\n",
        "* **Textbook Q&A** - Let's say you're studying for your exams and constantly flicking through a large textbook looking for answers to your quesitons. RAG can help provide answers as well as references to learn more.\n",

        "| Term | Description |\n",
        "| ----- | ----- |\n",
        "| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, \"hello, world!\" could be split into [\"hello\", \",\", \"world\", \"!\"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |\n",
        "| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |\n",
        "| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |\n",
        "| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |\n",
        "| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text \"hello, world!\", a genertive LLM may produce \"we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!\".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |\n",
        "| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |\n",
        "| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of \"[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)\" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like \"may output\" are used). |\n",

If you want all of your replicas to be of this type, you can simply use replicationFactor instead. tlogReplicas The number of TLOG replicas to create for this collection. This type of replica maintains a transaction log but only updates its index via replication from a leader. See the section Types of Replicas for more information about replica types. pullReplicas The number of PULL replicas to create for this collection. This type of replica does not maintain a transaction log and only updates its index via replication from a leader. This type is not eligible to become a leader and should not be the only type of replicas in the collection. See the section Types of Replicas for more information about replica types. maxShardsPerNode When creating collections, the shards and/or replicas are spread across all available (i.e., live) nodes, and two replicas of the same shard will never be on the same node. If a node is not live when the CREATE action is called, it will not get any parts of the new collection, which could lead to too many replicas being created on a single live node. Defining maxShardsPerNode sets a limit on the number of replicas the CREATE action will spread to each node. If the entire collection can not be fit into the live nodes, no collection will be created at all. The default maxShardsPerNode value is 1. A value of -1 means unlimited. If a policy is also specified then the stricter of maxShardsPerNode and policy rules apply. createNodeSet Allows defining the nodes to spread the new collection across. The format is a comma-separated list of node_names, such as localhost:8983_solr,localhost:8984_solr,localhost:8985_solr. If not provided, the CREATE operation will create shard-replicas spread across all live Solr nodes. Alternatively, use the special value of EMPTY to initially create no shard-replica within the new collection and then later use the ADDREPLICA operation to add shard-replicas when and where required. createNodeSet.shuffle Controls whether or not the shard-replicas created for this collection will be assigned to the nodes specified by the createNodeSet in a sequential manner, or if the list of nodes should be shuffled prior to creating individual replicas. A false value makes the results of a collection creation predictable and gives more exact control over the location of the individual shard-replicas, but true can be a better choice for ensuring replicas are distributed evenly across nodes. The default is true. This parameter is ignored if createNodeSet is not also specified. collection.configName Defines the name of the configuration (which must already be stored in ZooKeeper) to use for this collection. If not provided, Solr will use the configuration of _default configset to create a new (and mutable) configset named <collectionName>.AUTOCREATED and will use it for the new collection.

Stopwords with Complex Phrase Parser It is recommended not to use stopword elimination with this query parser. Lets say we add the terms the, up, and to to stopwords.txt for your collection, and index a document containing the text \"Stores up to 15,000 songs, 25,00 photos, or 150 yours of video\" in a field named \"features\". While the query below does not use this parser: \\xa0q=features:\"Stores up to 15,000\" the document is returned. The next query that does use the Complex Phrase Query Parser, as in this query: \\xa0q=features:\"sto* up to 15*\"&defType=complexphrase does not return that document because SpanNearQuery has no good way to handle stopwords in a way analogous to PhraseQuery. If you must remove stopwords for your use case, use a custom filter factory or perhaps a customized synonyms filter that reduces given stopwords to some impossible token. Escaping with Complex Phrase Parser Special care has to be given when escaping: clauses between double quotes (usually whole query) is parsed twice, these parts have to be escaped as twice, e.g., \"foo\\\\\\\\: bar\\\\\\\\^\". Field Query Parser The FieldQParser extends the QParserPlugin and creates a field query from the input value, applying text analysis and constructing a phrase query if appropriate. The parameter f is the field to be queried. Example: {!field f=myfield}Foo Bar This example creates a phrase query with \"foo\" followed by \"bar\" (assuming the analyzer for myfield is a text field with an analyzer that splits on whitespace and lowercase terms). This is generally equivalent to the Lucene query parser expression myfield:\"Foo Bar\".

You will need to define the following parameters: class the fully qualified class name. For example, if you created a new request handler class called CRUDHandler, you would enter org.apache.solr.core.CRUDHandler. runtimeLib Set to true to require that this component should be loaded from the classloader that loads the runtime jars. For example, to use a blob named test, you would configure solrconfig.xml like this: <requestHandler name=\\\"/myhandler\\\" class=\\\"org.apache.solr.core.myHandler\\\" runtimeLib=\\\"true\\\" version=\\\"1\\\"> </requestHandler> If there are parameters available in the custom handler, you can define them in the same way as any other request handler definition. \\uf05a Blob store can only be used to dynamically load components configured in solrconfig.xml. Components specified in schema.xml cannot be loaded from blob store. Deleting Blobs Once loaded to the blob store, blobs are handled very similarly to usual indexed documents in Solr. To delete blobs, you can use the same approaches used to delete individual documents from the index, namely Delete By ID and Delete By Query. For example, to delete a blob with the id test/1, you would issue a command like this: curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\\\"delete\\\": {\\\"id\\\": \\\"test/1\\\"}}' http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/update?commit=true Page 1314 of 1483 Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.1 Guide Version 8.1 - Published: 2019-06-11 \\u00a9 2019, Apache Software Foundation\",\n          \"array(1, 2, 3) When this expression is sent to the /stream handler it responds with a JSON array: { \\u00a0 \\\"result-set\\\": { \\u00a0   \\\"docs\\\": [ \\u00a0     { \\u00a0       \\\"return-value\\\": [ \\u00a0         1, \\u00a0         2, \\u00a0         3 \\u00a0       ] \\u00a0     }, \\u00a0     { \\u00a0       \\\"EOF\\\": true, \\u00a0       \\\"RESPONSE_TIME\\\": 0 \\u00a0     } \\u00a0   ] \\u00a0 } } Array Operations Arrays can be passed as parameters to functions that operate on arrays. For example, an array can be reversed with the rev function: rev(array(1, 2, 3)) When this expression is sent to the /stream handler it responds with: Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.1 Page 895 of 1483 \\u00a9 2019, Apache Software Foundation Guide Version 8.1 - Published: 2019-06-11\",\n          \"Content Streams Content streams are bulk data passed with a request to Solr. When Solr RequestHandlers are accessed using path based URLs, the SolrQueryRequest object containing the parameters of the request may also contain a list of ContentStreams containing bulk data for the request. (The name SolrQueryRequest is a bit misleading: it is involved in all requests, regardless of whether it is a query request or an update request.) Content Stream Sources Currently request handlers can get content streams in a variety of ways: \\u2022 For multipart file uploads, each file is passed as a stream. \\u2022 For POST requests where the content-type is not application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the raw POST body is passed as a stream. The full POST body is parsed as parameters and included in the Solr parameters. \\u2022 The contents of parameter stream.body is passed as a stream. \\u2022 If remote streaming is enabled and URL content is called for during request handling, the contents of each stream.url and stream.file parameters are fetched and passed as a stream. By default, curl sends a contentType=\\\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\\" header. If you need to test a SolrContentHeader content stream, you will need to set the content type with curl\\u2019s -H flag. Remote Streaming Remote streaming lets you send the contents of a URL as a stream to a given Solr RequestHandler. You could use remote streaming to send a remote or local file to an update plugin. Remote streaming is disabled by default. Enabling it is not recommended in a production situation without additional security between you and untrusted remote clients. In solrconfig.xml, you can enable it by changing the following enableRemoteStreaming parameter to true: \\u00a0   *** WARNING *** \\u00a0   Before enabling remote streaming, you should make sure your \\u00a0   system has authentication enabled. \\u00a0   <requestParsers enableRemoteStreaming=\\\"false\\\" /> When enableRemoteStreaming is not specified in solrconfig.xml, the default behavior is to not allow remote streaming (i.e., enableRemoteStreaming=\\\"false\\\"). Remote streaming can also be enabled through the Config API as follows: Apache Solr Reference Guide 8.1 Page 435 of 1483 \\u00a9 2019, Apache Software Foundation Guide Version 8.1 - Published: 2019-06-11\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

So all downstream components (faceting, highlighting, etc.)will work with the collapsed result set.

        "\n",
        "While humans understand text, machines understand numbers best.\n",
        "\n",
        "An [embedding](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/index.html) is a broad concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most powerful thing about modern embeddings is that they are *learned* representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning rather than directly mapping words/tokens/characters to numbers (e.g. `{\"a\": 0, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 3...}`), the numerical representation of tokens is learned by going through large corpuses of text and figuring out how different tokens relate to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, embeddings of text will mean that similar meaning texts have similar numerical representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** Most modern NLP models deal with \"tokens\" which can be considered as multiple different sizes and combinations of words and characters rather than always whole words or single characters. For example, the string `\"hello world!\"` gets mapped to the token values `{15339: b'hello', 1917: b' world', 0: b'!'}` using [Byte pair encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) (or BPE via OpenAI's [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library). Google has a tokenization library called [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to turn each of our chunks into a numerical representation (an embedding vector, where a vector is a sequence of numbers arranged in order).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once our text samples are in embedding vectors, us humans will no longer be able to understand them.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we don't need to.\n",
        "\n",
        "The embedding vectors are for our computers to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use our computers to find patterns in the embeddings and then we can use their text mappings to further our understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enough talking, how about we import a text embedding model and see what an embedding looks like.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do so, we'll use the [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/installation.html) library which contains many pre-trained embedding models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we'll get the `all-mpnet-base-v2` model (you can see the model's intended use on the [Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2#intended-uses))."

        "\n",
        "We discussed RAG briefly in the beginning but let's quickly recap.\n",

        "Which is another way of saying \"given a query, search for relevant resources and answer based on those resources\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's breakdown each step:\n",
        "* **Retrieval** - Get relevant resources given a query. For example, if the query is \"what are the macronutrients?\" the ideal results will contain information about protein, carbohydrates and fats (and possibly alcohol) rather than information about which tractors are the best for farming (though that is also cool information).\n",
        "* **Augmentation** - LLMs are capable of generating text given a prompt. However, this generated text is designed to *look* right. And it often has some correct information, however, they are prone to hallucination (generating a result that *looks* like legit text but is factually wrong). In augmentation, we pass relevant information into the prompt and get an LLM to use that relevant information as the basis of its generation.\n",
        "* **Generation** - This is where the LLM will generate a response that has been flavoured/augmented with the retrieved resources. In turn, this not only gives us a potentially more correct answer, it also gives us resources to investigate more (since we know which resources went into the prompt).\n",
        "\n",
        "The whole idea of RAG is to get an LLM to be more factually correct based on your own input as well as have a reference to where the generated output may have come from.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an incredibly helpful tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you had 1000s of customer support documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "You could use RAG to generate direct answers to questions with links to relevant documentation.\n",

        "Or you were an insurance company with large chains of claims emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "You could use RAG to answer questions about the emails with sources.\n",

Called SolrCloud, these capabilities provide distributed indexing and search capabilities, supporting the following features: • Central configuration for the entire cluster • Automatic load balancing and fail-over for queries • ZooKeeper integration for cluster coordination and configuration. SolrCloud is flexible distributed search and indexing, without a master node to allocate nodes, shards and replicas. Instead, Solr uses ZooKeeper to manage these locations, depending on configuration files and schemas. Queries and updates can be sent to any server. Solr will use the information in the ZooKeeper database to figure out which servers need to handle the request. In this section, we’ll cover everything you need to know about using Solr in SolrCloud mode.\n",
